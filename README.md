# **Graduation Research - Spiking Neural Network for Spike Signal Classification**

## ðŸ“š **Project Overview**
This project focuses on using **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** to classify spike signals recorded from neurons. The goal is to analyze the distinct patterns of neuronal spike signals and build a robust classification model that can accurately identify and differentiate between them.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Research Background**
Neuronal spike signals have unique waveform characteristics depending on the neuron type. Traditional neural networks are limited in processing spike timing-based data, which is essential for spike signal classification. In this project, SNNs, which simulate biological neurons and use spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to update synaptic weights, were applied to solve this classification challenge.
